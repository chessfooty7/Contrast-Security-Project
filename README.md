# Contrast-Security-Project

This is a Java Web App using Maven, Tomcat as the server, Eclipse. It is a simple web app which displays my stock portfolio, but has a metrics filter extension which monitors all http requests and calculates various attributes like response size and request time. This data is processed in thread safe data structures and displayed for the user. Every time there is a commit/push on this repository, github actions with compile,build, and test the application.

I built this project for my Contrast Security Interview and to also enhance my knowledge about web apps and web development tools like Github Actions.

To deploy the application, simply clone this repository with link https://github.com/chessfooty7/Contrast-Security-Project.git and follow the instructions in this link: https://www.theserverside.com/video/Step-by-step-Maven-Tomcat-WAR-file-deploy-example
